Iris Flower Classification Model ðŸŒ¸

This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three speciesâ€”Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginicaâ€”using machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of sepal and petal measurements, which are used to train models for accurate classification.

ðŸ”¹ Algorithms Used:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
->>A distance-based algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors. The best k-value is chosen through hyperparameter tuning.

Decision Tree (DT) 
->>A rule-based model that creates a tree structure by splitting features at decision nodes to maximize information gain. Easy to visualize and interpret.

K-Means Clustering ðŸŽ¯
->>An unsupervised learning algorithm that groups similar data points into 3 clusters based on feature similarity. Helps in pattern recognition and species clustering without predefined labels.
